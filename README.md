# space-invaders
A small project created with the purpose of finding out more about creating graphics and using bitmapping in c++. VAOs were used for each layer of graphics, and bitmapping was created to generate and draw sprites. The intention was to create a game from scratch with interactive guides on OpenGL and c++ in general.
